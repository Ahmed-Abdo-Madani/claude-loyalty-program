ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€Key strategies for scaling your platform

To ensure the API limit does not impact growth, your development strategy should account for both steady and peak traffic. 
1. Queue requests for pass creation
How it works: Instead of immediately calling the Google Wallet API to generate a new pass every time a user signs up, add the user's information to a queue. A separate, background process then pulls from the queue at a steady rate (e.g., 5-10 requests per second) and sends the data to the Google Wallet API.
Benefits: This "throttling" or "batching" of requests ensures you never exceed the 20 requests/second limit, even during periods of heavy user sign-ups. Your main user-facing application remains fast and responsive because it only has to add a record to the queue, not wait for the API response. 
2. Handle errors with exponential backoff
What it is: In the unlikely event that your application hits the rate limit and receives a "429 Too Many Requests" error, it should not immediately retry the request. Instead, it should use an exponential backoff strategy, which increases the waiting time before retrying.
How it works: Wait a short period (e.g., 1 second), then retry. If it fails again, wait longer (e.g., 2 seconds), and so on. This prevents your platform from creating a cycle of continuous failing requests and helps the API server recover. 
3. Cache static information
How it works: If you have information that doesn't change frequently (like your loyalty program's details), cache it locally on your servers. This reduces the number of GET requests your platform needs to make to the Google Wallet API.
Benefits: Reduces the overall volume of API calls, further protecting you from hitting the rate limit. 
4. Consider a rate limit increase
How it works: If you anticipate extremely high and prolonged traffic that cannot be managed through queuing (e.g., millions of users signing up simultaneously), you can request a rate limit increase from Google.
Process: This is done through your Google Cloud project console, and a justification for the increase is required. This would be a solution for significant, sustained growth that exceeds your initial projections.
