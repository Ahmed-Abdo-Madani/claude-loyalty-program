## 🔄 Render.com Auto-Deployment

Your changes have been pushed to GitHub. Render.com will automatically detect the push and deploy:

### Expected Timeline:

**Backend (api.madna.me):**
- ⏱️ Deployment trigger: ~30 seconds after push
- ⏱️ Build time: 2-3 minutes
- ⏱️ Start time: 10-20 seconds
- **Total: ~3-4 minutes**

**Frontend (app.madna.me):**
- ⏱️ Deployment trigger: ~30 seconds after push
- ⏱️ Build time: 2-3 minutes
- ⏱️ Deploy time: 30-60 seconds
- **Total: ~3-4 minutes**

---

## ✅ NEXT STEPS (Manual Verification)

### Step 1: Monitor Render Dashboard (NOW)

1. **Go to:** https://dashboard.render.com
2. **Check Backend Service:** madna-loyalty-backend
   - Look for "Deploy started" notification
   - Monitor build logs
   - Wait for "Deploy live" status

3. **Check Frontend Service:** madna-loyalty-frontend
   - Look for "Deploy started" notification
   - Monitor build logs
   - Wait for "Deploy live" status

### Step 2: Health Check (After ~4 minutes)

```bash
# Test API health
curl https://api.madna.me/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T...",
  "service": "loyalty-platform-backend",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Step 3: Verify New Features (After health check passes)

**Backend Logs to Look For:**
```
💾 Database pool initialized: { environment: 'production', ... }
🚀 Madna Loyalty Platform Backend running on port 3001
Rate limiter cleanup: removed X expired IP entries (every 5 min)
```

**Frontend:**
- Visit: https://app.madna.me
- Open DevTools → Network tab
- Navigate to different pages
- Verify lazy loading (chunks load on demand)

### Step 4: Test Rate Limiting

```bash
# Send 105 requests rapidly
for i in {1..105}; do
  curl -s -w "%{http_code}\n" https://api.madna.me/api/wallet/pass/test$i -o /dev/null
done

# Should see:
# - First ~100 requests: 200 or 404
# - After ~100: 429 (Too Many Requests)
```

## 📊 What to Monitor (First 2 Hours)

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Health check returning 200 OK
- No errors in Render logs
- Response times < 100ms
- Memory usage stable
- Database pool logs appearing every 30s
- Rate limit cleanup logs every 5 minutes

### ⚠️ Warning Signs:
- High response times (>200ms average)
- Database pool exhaustion warnings
- Memory growth (>10% per hour)
- Unhandled rejection errors
- Rate limit false positives

## 🔍 Render.com Dashboard - What to Check

### Backend Service Logs
Look for these messages:
```
✅ Google Wallet: Loading credentials from file
💾 Database pool initialized: ...
🚀 Madna Loyalty Platform Backend running on port 3001
📍 Base URL: https://api.madna.me
❤️ Health check: https://api.madna.me/health
```

**Good Signs:**
- No error stack traces
- Clean startup
- No "EADDRINUSE" errors (error handler will catch these)
- Pool monitoring logs appearing

**Bad Signs:**
- 🔴 Uncaught Exception messages
- Database connection errors
- Missing environment variables

### Frontend Service Logs
Look for:
```
✓ 237 modules transformed
✓ built in X.XXs
Generated chunks with optimized sizes
```

**Good Signs:**
- Build completes successfully
- Multiple chunk files generated (24+)
- No bundle size warnings

---

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Quick Checks:
1. **API Not Responding:**
   - Check Render backend service status
   - Look for database connection errors
   - Verify environment variables set

2. **Frontend Not Loading:**
   - Check Render static site status
   - Verify build completed
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Rate Limiting Issues:**
   - Check if /health endpoint still exempt
   - Verify production limit is 100 (not 500)
   - Look for cleanup logs

### Rollback Procedure:
```bash
# From Render Dashboard:
1. Go to service
2. Click "Rollback to previous deploy"
3. Confirm

# OR from command line:
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# Render will auto-deploy the revert
```

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### Backend:
- **Throughput:** Should handle 3,000+ req/s
- **Latency P95:** Should be < 50ms (we tested 18ms)
- **Latency P99:** Should be < 100ms (we tested 23ms)
- **Memory:** Should stay stable (tested: 3.5% growth over 60s)

### Frontend:
- **Initial Load:** < 2 seconds on 3G
- **Bundle Size:** Main chunk ~144 KB
- **Total JS:** ~630 KB (split across 24 chunks)
- **Lazy Loading:** Only 3 pages load initially
