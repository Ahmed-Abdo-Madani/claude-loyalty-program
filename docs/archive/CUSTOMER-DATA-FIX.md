# Customer Data Fix - "Guest Customer" Issue

## 🐛 Problem Description

**Issue**: All new customers show up in the Customer Tab as:
```
Guest Customer
No email
No phone
```

**Root Cause**: Data mapping mismatch between frontend customer signup form and backend customer creation service.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Data Flow Problem:

1. **Frontend (CustomerSignup.jsx)** sends:
   ```javascript
   {
     customerId: "cust_...",
     firstName: "John",
     lastName: "Smith",
     whatsapp: "+966501234567",  // ← Note: "whatsapp"
     birthday: "1990-01-15",
     ...
   }
   ```

2. **Backend (business.js:809-822)** was receiving but **incorrectly mapping**:
   ```javascript
   // ❌ OLD CODE (WRONG):
   {
     name: `${customerData.firstName} ${customerData.lastName}`,  // ← Single "name" field
     whatsapp: customerData.whatsapp,  // ← Wrong field name
     birthday: customerData.birthday,  // ← Wrong field name
   }
   ```

3. **CustomerService.findOrCreateCustomer()** expects:
   ```javascript
   // ✅ WHAT IT NEEDS:
   {
     firstName: "John",      // ← Separate first_name
     lastName: "Smith",      // ← Separate last_name
     phone: "+966501234567", // ← "phone", not "whatsapp"
     email: null,            // ← email field
     date_of_birth: "1990-01-15",  // ← date_of_birth, not "birthday"
   }
   ```

### Result:
- CustomerService received `name` instead of `firstName`/`lastName`
- CustomerService received `whatsapp` instead of `phone`
- CustomerService received `birthday` instead of `date_of_birth`
- All data was ignored, defaulted to "Guest" and "Customer"

## ✅ Fix Applied

### File Modified: `backend/routes/business.js`
**Lines**: 809-823

**Before (WRONG)**:
```javascript
const progress = await CustomerService.createCustomerProgress(
  customerData.customerId,
  offerId,
  offer.business_id,
  {
    name: `${customerData.firstName || ''} ${customerData.lastName || ''}`.trim() || 'Guest Customer',
    whatsapp: customerData.whatsapp || null,
    birthday: customerData.birthday || null,
    source: customerData.source || 'in_store',
    branch: customerData.branch || null
  }
)
```

**After (FIXED)**:
```javascript
const progress = await CustomerService.createCustomerProgress(
  customerData.customerId,
  offerId,
  offer.business_id,
  {
    firstName: customerData.firstName || 'Guest',      // ✅ firstName field
    lastName: customerData.lastName || 'Customer',     // ✅ lastName field
    phone: customerData.whatsapp || null,              // ✅ phone field (mapped from whatsapp)
    email: customerData.email || null,                 // ✅ email field
    date_of_birth: customerData.birthday || null,      // ✅ date_of_birth field (mapped from birthday)
    source: customerData.source || 'in_store',
    branch: customerData.branch || null
  }
)
```

## 🔄 How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Backend is Already Fixed ✅
The code changes have been saved to `backend/routes/business.js`

### Step 2: Restart Backend Server

**If backend is running in a terminal**:
1. Find the terminal running the backend
2. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server
3. Run:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Wait for:
   ```
   🚀 Madna Loyalty Platform Backend running on port 3001
   ```

**If backend is NOT running**:
```powershell
cd c:\Users\Design_Bench_12\Documents\claude-loyalty-program\backend
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test with NEW Customer Signup

**Important**: This fix only affects NEW customers created after the restart. Existing "Guest Customer" records won't change.

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Case 1: Create New Customer
1. Open a **private/incognito browser window** (to avoid cached wallet passes)
2. Navigate to a customer signup URL (from QR code or direct link)
3. Fill out the form:
   - First Name: "John"
   - Last Name: "Smith"
   - Phone: "+966 50 123 4567"
   - Birthday: Select a date
4. Click "JOIN & ADD TO WALLET"
5. **Expected**: Customer should be created successfully

### Test Case 2: Verify in Customer Tab
1. Go to business dashboard: http://localhost:3000
2. Login to your business account
3. Navigate to **Dashboard → Customers Tab**
4. **Look for the new customer**
5. **Expected Result**:
   ```
   John Smith                  Active
   (no email)                  🌱 new customer
   +966 50 123 4567           1 visits
                               0 stamps
   ```

### Test Case 3: Search for Customer
1. In the Customer Tab search box
2. Type "John"
3. **Expected**: John Smith appears in results
4. Type the phone number
5. **Expected**: John Smith appears in results

│ +966 50 123 4567             1 visits        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 🗄️ Existing "Guest Customer" Records

### What About Old Records?

**Option 1: Leave Them (Recommended)**
- Old "Guest Customer" records represent real customers
- They have progress data and scan history
- Deleting them would lose valuable data
- Just let them be - new signups will work correctly

**Option 2: Update Manually (If Needed)**
If you know which real customer a "Guest Customer" record belongs to, you can update via SQL:

```sql
-- Check existing Guest Customer records
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, phone, created_at
FROM customers
WHERE first_name = 'Guest' AND last_name = 'Customer'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Update a specific one (if you know their real info)
UPDATE customers
SET
  first_name = 'John',
  last_name = 'Smith',
  phone = '+966501234567'
WHERE customer_id = 'cust_xxxxxxxxxxxxx';
```

**Option 3: Delete Test Records (Be Careful!)**
If these are all test customers with no real data:

```sql
-- DANGER: This deletes data! Only use for test records!
-- First check what will be deleted:
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE first_name = 'Guest' AND last_name = 'Customer';

-- If you're SURE these are test records:
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE first_name = 'Guest'
  AND last_name = 'Customer'
  AND created_at > '2025-10-13';  -- Only today's test records
```

## 🎯 Related Files Changed

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `backend/routes/business.js` | Fixed customer data mapping (lines 809-823) | ✅ FIXED |
| `backend/models/Customer.js` | Already correct (uses first_name/last_name) | ✅ OK |
| `backend/services/CustomerService.js` | Already correct (expects firstName/lastName) | ✅ OK |
| `src/components/CustomersTab.jsx` | Already has null-safety fixes | ✅ OK |

## 💡 Why This Happened

This is a classic **schema evolution issue**:

1. **Original Design**: Customer model had a single `name` field
2. **Migration**: Changed to `first_name` + `last_name` (better for UX)
3. **Forgot to Update**: Signup endpoint still passed old `name` field
4. **Field Mismatch**: Service layer expected `firstName`/`lastName`
5. **Result**: All data ignored, defaulted to "Guest Customer"

---

## ✅ Prevention for Future

### Code Review Checklist:
- [ ] Check all endpoints that create/update customers
- [ ] Verify field names match between frontend → backend → database
- [ ] Test with real data after schema changes
- [ ] Add TypeScript for compile-time type checking (future improvement)

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Test customer signup end-to-end
- [ ] Verify data appears correctly in Customer Tab
- [ ] Test search/filter with real customer data
- [ ] Check database directly to confirm data is saved

**Fix Applied!** 🎉

New customers will now be created with their actual names and phone numbers. Remember to restart the backend server to apply the changes!
