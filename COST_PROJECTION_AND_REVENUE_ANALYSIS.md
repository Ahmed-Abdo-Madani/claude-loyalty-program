## Appendix A: Cost Calculator

Use this formula to estimate monthly costs at different scales:

```
Monthly Cost = Infrastructure + Services + Operations

Infrastructure = Frontend + Backend + Database
  - Startup (<10K users): $45
  - Growth (10K-50K): $195
  - Scale (50K-200K): $700

Services = Wallets + Email + SMS + Storage + Monitoring
  - Year 1: $24
  - Year 2: $209
  - Year 3: $414

Operations = Development + Support + Marketing + Admin
  - Year 1: $2,167
  - Year 2: $5,742
  - Year 3: $19,383

Revenue = (Pro_Customers × $29) + (Enterprise_Customers × $99) + Add_ons

Profit = Revenue - Monthly_Cost
```
