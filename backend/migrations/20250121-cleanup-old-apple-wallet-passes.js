/**
 * Migration: Clean Up Old Apple Wallet Passes
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Remove old Apple Wallet passes that were created before the authentication token
 * consistency fix (2025-10-21). These passes have mismatched authentication tokens
 * causing "Invalid authentication token" errors when users try to delete them.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES:
 * 1. Identifies Apple Wallet passes created before 2025-10-21
 * 2. Marks them as 'deleted' status (soft delete - preserves data)
 * 3. Deletes associated device registrations to stop unregister attempts
 * 4. Logs count of affected passes
 *
 * WHY SAFE:
 * - Only affects Apple Wallet passes (Google Wallet unaffected)
 * - Soft delete (data preserved, can be restored if needed)
 * - Users will need to re-add passes by scanning QR code again
 * - New passes will have correct authentication tokens
 *
 * IMPACT:
 * - Eliminates "Invalid authentication token" errors in production logs
 * - Clean slate for Apple Wallet with proper authentication
 * - Old passes on user devices will appear as expired/deleted
